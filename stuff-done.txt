GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - currently when there is selection clicking outside of it just ends the selection,
    ideally it should start new selection if the mouse is moved, like in real paint
  - fix bug in useRectangularSelection (there is a comment explaining it)
  - there are still some places where we could get rid of setTimeout, also consider using effects with callbacks
    instead of MutationObservers
  - some resizers on selection seem to be slightly misplaced (probably because border was changed to outline)

DONE:
