GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - changes to code can cause primaryCanvas to lose it's background color and become transparent, it does not seem that there is user action
    that can cause that but it may need to be investigated
  - certain selection operations are now disabled on shapes as they dont work properly with them
  - fix FreeFormSelection selecting shapes that are not exactly like expected
  - make brush indicators drawn by doDrawIcon pixelated
  - make code repeated between useShape and useRectangularSelection shared
  - fix scaling issues with selectionCanvas
  - rework useMove / useResize, remove window specific code and put it in callbacks
  - changes to useMove could potentially make selectionCanvas perfectly aligned with primaryCanvas (would move pixel by pixel)

DONE:
