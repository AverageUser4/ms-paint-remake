GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - adjust cursor centers (used in variables.css), as theses should be slightly different depending on canvasZoom
  - brushes should have shape indicating where they will be painting (smiliar to eraser)
  - when going into full screen window mode, rulers dont adjust size until render is caused by eg. moving mouse over canvas
  - resizing selection in left / top directions looks weird
  - implemented changing size of tool using ctrl + +/-
  - top right corner of selection shows resize indicator in wrong place
  
DONE:
