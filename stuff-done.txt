GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - when going into full screen window mode, rulers dont adjust size until render is caused by eg. moving mouse over canvas
  - resizing selection in left / top directions looks weird
  - useResizeCursor seems to be completly broken

DONE:
