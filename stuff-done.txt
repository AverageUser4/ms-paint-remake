GOING TO:
  - investigate font-family
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - currently when there is selection, clicking outside of it just ends the selection,
    ideally it should start new selection if the mouse is moved, like in real paint
  - fix bug in useRectangularSelection (there is a comment explaining it)
  - there are still some places where we could get rid of setTimeout, also consider using effects with callbacks
    instead of MutationObservers
  - some resizers on selection seem to be slightly misplaced (probably because border was changed to outline)
  - add missing shapes
  - consider using transform: translate instead of position for moving elements
  - ContextMenu, minimized Ribbon and possibly other elements are not animated when disappearing
  - improve window focus management (window does not lose focus when tabbing out of it, etc.)
  - implement recent files (in FileDropdownMore)
  - inner windows and dropdowns should trap focus
  
DONE:
  - add functionality to ContextMenu when open over the window (top part)
  - minor changes to MainWindowContext
