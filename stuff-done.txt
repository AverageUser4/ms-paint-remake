GOING TO:
  - contents of different Contexts are messy and all over the place (doSetCurrentTool in SelectionContext, etc.)
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - there are still some places where we could get rid of setTimeout, also consider using effects with callbacks
    instead of MutationObservers
  - add missing shapes
  - consider using transform: translate instead of position for moving elements
  - ContextMenu, minimized Ribbon and possibly other elements are not animated when disappearing
  - improve window focus management (window does not lose focus when tabbing out of it, etc.)
  - implement recent files (in FileDropdownMore)
  - inner windows and dropdowns should trap focus
  - calling doSelectionSelectAll (and possilby other functions) when selection is moved / resized gives pretty weird behavior
  - look into possibility of selection / shapes not getting written to primary and ended when zoom changes
  - secondaryCanvas does not get cleared on cancel if mouse is moving
  
DONE:
