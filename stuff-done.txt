GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - changes to code can cause primaryCanvas to lose it's background color and become transparent, it does not seem that there is user action
    that can cause that but it may need to be investigated
  - fix FreeFormSelection selecting shapes that are not exactly like expected
  - make code repeated between useShape and useRectangularSelection shared
  - rework useMove / useResize, remove window specific code and put it in callbacks, the way outline is used is kinda weird
  - changes to useMove could potentially make selectionCanvas perfectly aligned with primaryCanvas (would move pixel by pixel)
  - make brush indicators drawn by doDrawIcon pixelated

DONE:
