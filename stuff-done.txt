GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - changes to code can cause primaryCanvas to lose it's background color and become transparent, it does not seem that there is user action
    that can cause that but it may need to be investigated
  - fix FreeFormSelection selecting shapes that are not exactly like expected
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - currently when there is selection clicking outside of it just ends the selection,
    ideally it should start new selection if the mouse is moved, like in real paint
  - fix bug in useRectangularSelection (there is a comment explaining it)
  - traversing history is buggy
  - image data may be unnecesserily used in some cases (copy of canvas may be enough)
  - pasting image or select all may cause brush canvas to get stuck (tool changes to one which doesnt cause it to be cleared)

DONE:
