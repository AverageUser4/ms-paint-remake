GOING TO:
  - contents of different Contexts are messy and all over the place (doSetCurrentTool in SelectionContext, etc.)
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - there are still some places where we could get rid of setTimeout, also consider using effects with callbacks
    instead of MutationObservers
  - add missing shapes
  - consider using transform: translate instead of position for moving elements
  - ContextMenu, minimized Ribbon and possibly other elements are not animated when disappearing
  - improve window focus management (window does not lose focus when tabbing out of it, etc.)
  - implement recent files (in FileDropdownMore)
  - inner windows and dropdowns should trap focus
  - calling doSelectionSelectAll (and possilby other functions) when selection is moved / resized gives pretty weird behavior
  - look into possibility of selection / shapes not getting written to primary and ended when zoom changes
  - look into possibility of using svgs for shapes
  - Line should be drawn without antialiasing
  - fill dropdown in Shapes should be disabled when current shape cannot have fill
  - check how new shapes work with History
  - make Line, Polygon, Curve size check (that are used 2 times) into functions
  - when using alternate mouse buttons during Polygon / Curve creation, it changes color, although it should not
  - look into new shapes behavior when canvas size / color / tool changes (may still work not as expected for some)
  - after changing fill of shape to one using texture (eg. crayon), it cannot be changed to solid color (any shape, doesn't seem too happen with outline)

DONE:
