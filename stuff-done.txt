GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - changes to code can cause primaryCanvas to lose it's background color and become transparent, it does not seem that there is user action
    that can cause that but it may need to be investigated
  - brushCanvas is just another canvas that is unnecessarily big, causing lag when canvasSize is big, probably small canvas that moves would be a better solution

DONE:
