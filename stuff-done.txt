GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - changes to code can cause primaryCanvas to lose it's background color and become transparent, it does not seem that there is user action
    that can cause that but it may need to be investigated

DONE:
  - moved doShared* functions from SelectionContext to ActionsContext
