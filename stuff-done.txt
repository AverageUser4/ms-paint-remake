GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - rework outline in useResize
  - when primaryCanvas is huge, secondaryCanvas could be only of size of currently viewed area, positioned correctly,
  that could improve performance greatly
  - add unit tests to funcions in utils
  - currently when there is selection clicking outside of it just ends the selection,
    ideally it should start new selection if the mouse is moved, like in real paint
  - fix bug in useRectangularSelection (there is a comment explaining it)
  - there are still some places where we could get rid of setTimeout, also consider using effects with callbacks
    instead of MutationObservers
  - some resizers on selection seem to be slightly misplaced (probably because border was changed to outline)
  - add missing shapes

  - dropdowns don't open on focus + enter for some reason (click event is dispatched)
  - after drawing to canvas (or maybe some other action associated with it) all the buttons stop responding to focus + enter
  - user can tab through elements that are supposed to be disabled
  - inner windows don't trap focus
  - dropdowns should get closed when Escape key is pressed
  - focusing element within main window with tab now makes main window focused, fixing dropdowns not opening

DONE:
  - fixed tabbing not working when window was focused (because of GlobalShortcuts calling preventDefault)
  - fixed accessibility issues caused by GlobalShortcuts
