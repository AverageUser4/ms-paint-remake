GOING TO:
  - investigate z-index
  - investigate font-family
  - when going into full screen window mode, rulers dont adjust size until render is caused by eg. moving mouse over canvas
  - brushCanvas is just another canvas that is unnecessarily big, causing lag when canvasSize is big, probably small canvas that moves would be a better solution

DONE:
