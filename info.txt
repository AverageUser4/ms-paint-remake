  - sets width and height attributes of both primaryCanva and secondaryCanvas

canvasStyle:
  - contains width and height from canvasSize multiplied by canvasZoom
  - sets width and height STYLE attribute of primaryCanvas and secondaryCanvas
  - sets width and height attribute of brushCanvas

selectionSize:
  - sets both style and normal width and height attributes of selectionCanvas (is being changed)

useResize:
  - arguments passed by useSelection:
    - position: selectionOutlinePosition || selectionPosition
    - setPosition: setSelectionOutlinePosition
    - size: selectionOutlineSize || selectionSize
    - setSize: setSelectionOutlineSize
    - minimalSize: { width: 1, height: 1 }
    - canvasZoom: canvasZoom
    - containerRef: primaryRef
    - isConstrained: false

    - is invoked on one of resizers
    - sets resizeData
    - sets hasMoved do false

  - resizeData is set to:
    - type - string indicating which resizer is pressed
    - initialClientX : event.clientX
    - initialPositionX: position.x
    - initialWidth: round(size.width * canvasZoom)
    - resizerDiffX: ??????????
  - resizeData never changes, only when user releases mouse button it is set to null

  - resizeOutlineElement:
    - left: position?.x * canvasZoom || 0
    - width: hasMoved ? size.width : resizeData.initialWidth
    
  - onPressEndCallback:
    - selectionSize.width = selectionOutlineSize.width / canvasZoom
    - selectionPosition.x = selectionOutlinePosition.x

  - onPressedMove:
    - sets hasMoved to true

  - RELEVANT:
    - position: selectionOutlinePosition || selectionPosition
