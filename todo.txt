- z-index
- font-family
- Dropdown for some reason now have both appearance and disappearance animated, although only disappearance should be animated
- if buttons werent able to receive click events when window is not focused that would get rid of minor visual glitches and be consistent with OG paint
- adjust cursor centers (used in variables.css), as theses should be slightly different depending on canvasZoom
- brushes should have shape indicating where they will be painting (smiliar to eraser)
- when going into full screen window mode, rulers dont adjust size until render is caused by eg. moving mouse over canvas
- adjust size of resizers in Canvas (dots)
