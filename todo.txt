- z-index
- font-family
- hovering mouse over canvas still causes some unwanted rerenders
- Dropdown for some reason now have both appearance and disappearance animated, although only disappearance should be animated
- if buttons werent able to receive click events when window is not focused that would get rid of minor visual glitches and be consistent with OG paint

- the way some flags are passed to Window (through PainXPlatform) is somewhat confusing (default values), like really should be fixed NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
